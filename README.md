## Introduction

NN Traders is a B2B business specializing in selling home textiles such as curtains, bedsheets, doormats, and blankets in Rourkela and its nearby region. The project aims to address the inefficiencies in their inventory management, transportation logistics, and payment collection processes through detailed data analysis.

## Organization Background

NN Traders, established in 2017, has built a reputation for providing high-quality home textile products. As the business expanded, it faced challenges in data management and operations, necessitating the implementation of advanced data management techniques to maintain its competitive edge.
